# Movie Search Engine

**Team Members**: Daniel Guzman, Gozde Karamanoglu, Harvey Zhang, Jake Li, Jeffrey Lai, Kevin Camacho

**Goal**: We want to create a movie search engine based on user text search. In most streaming websites, users can only filter categorically based on genre, year, producer, etc. Another common way is to search for movie titles directly. Currently, we donâ€™t have methods for users to enter what they want to watch and populate results based on that. Our end product will solve this problem and allow users to search for movies in a new and interesting way.
